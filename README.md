# HTML : Final Assignment 

Homework by Adonis Dulaurent for Chlo√© Pochon 

## Instruction 

Using the text and images provided, structure an identical web page in HTML and CSS with the same characteristics. 
You must also comment on your code, explaining your approach and any difficulties you encountered.
As always, there's no single answer, but the code must be valid.

## Features 

- The page must be responsive, preferring the flexbox model
- On medium and small screen sizes, the insert is placed above the main block (@media (max-width: 768px){....})
- When the cursor hovers over menu items, there should be an interaction (here, the text turns yellow).
- When you click on a menu item, the content of the main insert scrolls to the relevant section (anchoring).
- At least one font must be inserted
